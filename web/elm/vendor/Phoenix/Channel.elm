**Note**: The effect manager will automatically try to reconnect to the server and to rejoin the channel. See `onRejoin` for details.
-}

{-| Set a callback which will be called after you sucessfully rejoined the channel after a disconnect. Useful if you want to catch up missed messages.

        |> onRejoin IsOnline
-}

        |> onLeave LeftLobby
-}

*(It seems that Phoenix v1.2 doesn't send this)*
-}
